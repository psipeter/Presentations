One reason that these details may turn out to be important is that evolution isn’t usually wasteful: many of the biological mechanisms in a neuron may contribute to information processing in the brain. The differences between the capabilities of biological neurons and classical point neuron support the hypothesis that biological mechanisms play some useful computational role."

Similarly, the effects of drugs on the brain, both for the treatment of such disorders or for recreation, are best understood through their neurochemical effect on the targeted brain regions. Relatedly, modulatory systems in the brain, especially those involved in emotion, utilize neuromodulators to control other brain regions. For example, acetylcholine has been implicated in directing and sustaining attention, while norepinephrine is involved in coordinating fear responses."

During the delay period (2, 4, 6, or 8s), the monkey stores the cue location in WM, then recalls that location in the response period by pressing the corresponding button or making a saccade.\n",

    "Physiologically, GFC and PHE work by closing HCN channels, specialized ion channels present in certain cells in the brain. At rest, HCN channels permit the influx of non-specific cations, but deactivate in response to depolarization. HCN channels are unevenly distributed along the dendritic tree, with an almost sevenfold increase in density from the somatic to distal end of the dendrites. These properties allow HCN channels to reduce the temporal variability of dendritic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) that exists due to spatial distribution along the dendritic tree. It is believed that these channels control the excitability of pyramidal neurons in PFC by modulating the temporal dendritic summation and resting potential.\n",

    "2. Change the gain $\\alpha_i$ of each neuron so that it responds more strongly to inputs. This can be accomplished in nengo by creating a custom node class that behaves like a normal ensemble, but has methods for setting encoders, alpha, and bias. Then hope that increasing alpha will keep unaligned neurons quiet but increase the activity of neurons with appropriate $e_i$. Thanks to Xuan Choo for this implementation.\n",

    "In tasks related to fear learning, extinction, and expression, animals learn an association between a neutral stimulus (auditory tone) and an aversive stimulus (footshock). When the neutral stimulus is presented alone, animal should exhibit the fear response (freezing). The experimental design for this training and testing is simple: present tones and coincident footshocks to the animal some number of times, then present just tone and observe how often it freezes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can model fear conditioning using a simple circuit that relies on one of nengo's learning rules. There are two stimulus populations, US=unconditioned stimulus (shock) and CS=conditioned stimulus (tone). The lateral amygdala (LA) population represents the presence of US and the current fear response to CS (2 dimensions. One error population calculates the difference between ideal response to CS and the current response to CS. Finally one motor population represents the animal's movement, which is normally active but is inhibited by LA during fear expression.\n",

    "<img src=\"images/fear_model.png\" width=500>\n",

    "The simulation proceeds as follows. During the training phase, a CS stimulus turns on for 10s and the US turns on for the last 2s of CS, constituting a single “pairing” or training example. The connection between CS and LA is initially set to zero but updated through the PES learning rule (credit goes to Trevor Bekolay and crew). The error population receives inputs from the LA and computes $f(x)=US-CS$; it is forced positive by the tuning curve distribution (all LIF intercepts above zero). During training, the error population changes the CS-LA connection, so that future CS stimulus will invoke larger response in LA. During testing, the CS is presented without the US. When LA is active, it inhibits the motor population, causing fear-induced freezing.\n",

    "Injecting the drug muscimol into the lateral amygdala has been shown empirically to have two fear-related effects:\n",

    " - Reduced fear expression when applied during testing\n",
    " \n",
    "<img src=\"images/muscimol_empirical.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "Biophysically, muscimol is a GABA agonist, meaning that it binds to receptors in the cell membrane which usually are reserved for the neurotransmitter GABA. Because inhibitory neurons in the amygdala have a high number of GABA receptors, injecting muscimol dampens activity in LA neurons by exciting an inhibitory population.\n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis was that neurons in LA represent both fear response and are used to calculate error-based learning. This has the consequence that inhibiting these neurons will both reduce fear response and slow fear learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "To approximate the effects of muscimol, it is not sufficient to injecting negative stimulus into the LA using a stimulus node. Why do you think this is? The answer is somewhat subtle, but an important distinction in the NEF. Negative stimulus increases the activity of neurons with encoders in the negative direction, whereas inhibition in biological brains decreases the activity of all neurons equally, by opening ion channels that let negative ions into, or positive ions out of, the cell. To simulate this effect, without incorporating a full biophysical neuron model, we need to bypass the encoders and feed negative value directly onto the somas of the neurons. There are two ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a nengo connection directly onto the somas using ```nengo.connection(stimulus, target.neurons, transform=-1*np.ones([n_neurons,1]))```. This has a problem: it messes up whatever function is computed by the existing connection weights between CS and LA.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the Parisien transform, a mathematical tool developed by Chris Parisien, Charles Anderson, and Chris Eliasmith. In the NEF, connection weights from one ensemble to another have a mix of positive and negative sines, but in biological brains, almost all neurons are either excitatory or inhibitory, and neurons of both type exist in any population. The Parisien transform takes a normal NEF connection between A and B, creates a third ensemble C which projects with only negative connections to B.neurons, and recomputes the connection weights between A-B, A-C, and C-B so that the original function is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/parisien.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "I used option 2 to create an inhibitory neuron population in LA, which we know exists in biological brains. I then used a stimulus node to excite the inhibitory neurons, which mimics the biophysical effect of muscimol while preserving the learned transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In study whether this model and approximation of the drug effect reproduced the empirical findings, I ran two experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apply the drug during training and see if fear response is reduced during testing\n",
    "1. Apply the drug during testing and see if fear response is reduced during testing\n",
    "\n",
    "It does!\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/muscimol_model.png\" width=500>\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the drug works by modulating a population which has the dual responsibility of representing the fear response and learning that response during training. To simulate its biological mechanism, I had to more faithfully reproduce biological networks with distinct excitation and inhibition. Luckily, Terry's code fot the Parisien transform was the appropriate tool for this job."

Then the simulation deals with all the nonlinear interactions between the cell’s membrane currents and voltage-dependent ion-channel gating. However, specifying the magnitude of change in $g_{ion}$ in response to a drug is arbitrary, or at least difficult to relate to the amount of neurotransmitters injected in an empirical experiment. Using NEURON, you can also do fancy things like building a dendritic tree and specifying where the synaptic connections occur, or download the NEURON models from the HBP’s [neocortical microcircuit portal](https://bbp.epfl.ch/nmc-portal/downloads) and use these data to calibrate models of cortical systems.\n",
